            <p>To truly care for your skin, you need to start below the surface. Collagen Elixir™ nourishes your skin from the inside out, promoting enhanced elasticity, firmness, and hydration for a healthy and radiant complexion.</p>

            <h4>Beauty starts on the inside</h4>
            <p>Skin is the body’s largest organ and is composed of water, protein, and fat. Collagen is your body’s most abundant protein and creates structure, resilience, and elasticity. It acts like a glue that helps to hold everything in its place. Your body builds and repairs collagen every day, but collagen production gradually declines with age.</p>
            <p>Collagen builds the foundation of a smooth and radiant complexion. The deepest layers of skin are made of a dense network of collagen fibers. Over time, the network of collagen fibers can become fragmented and weakened, resulting in wrinkles, fine lines, and thinner skin.</p>
